    1. Have a clear goal.
A clear goal is a goal anyone in the world can measure and understand. Write out your goal and keep it posted somewhere as a reminder when you want to give up. If you have a set amount of weight you'd like to lose, step on the scale before you start. Then, weigh yourself every single day.

Studies show daily weigh-ins enhance weight loss efforts. But don't live and die by the number. And remember a scale doesn't decipher between fat and lean body mass—but it can help keep things in check.<br>

2. Ease up on processed carbs and junk food.
They do nothing for you outside of creating a favorable environment for gaining fat, including belly fat. If you have trouble managing particular treats—maybe it's chips, maybe it's cookies, maybe it's peanut butter—keep them out of your home or office cabinets. It's not about willpower; it's about being realistic. Instead, buy healthy snacks—like jerky—for your glove compartment or desk drawer so you're prepared at all times.<br>

3. Eat more produce.
Fruits and vegetables fill you up, provide plenty of fiber and have few calories. If you have trouble adding vegetables to your routine, start every meal with a salad. Salad provides bulk to help fill you up so that you eat less calories overall. Or try this hack to get a day's worth of healthy greens in 14 minutes. No smoothie required.<br>

4. Lift weights.
Develop an exercise plan that includes heavy weights. Build more muscle: Burn more calories. Make sure to cut down on rest time between sets. This keeps your heart rate elevated, causing an increase in calories burned. Use these tips to lift heavy the smart way.<br>

5. Do intervals.
Study after study continues to show intervals are more effective and time efficient than longer activity performed at a lower intensity. This super-simple partner interval workout gets the job done quickly.<br>

6. Do full-body exercises.
Your exercise plan—whether you're aiming to lose weight or not—shouldn't just focus on one area of your body. Instead, incorporate exercises that use your whole body. Think: squats, deadlifts, chin-ups, and pushups. You'll get more bang for your buck out of each workout. If you have trouble hitting the gym after work, consider waking up early to exercise.<br>

7. Track your food.
There's no better way to find out what you're putting in your mouth. Use a free app, like MyFitnessPal, which makes it easy to log from anywhere. Chances are you’re eating more than you think.<br>

8. Eat breakfast.
A study review published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that those who ate breakfast were more successful with long-term weight maintenance. Other research has shown the same for weight loss.<br>

9. Stay active.
This means not sitting in front of a computer, TV, or phone all day. Stand and you'll burn more and be more productive. Taking the stairs instead of the elevator can help burn more calories, too. This won't make or break success, but every little bit helps when it comes to physical activity.<br>

10. Bake, don't fry.
You'll save calories and lower your risk of heart disease. Or try an air fryer—you can even make chicken in it.<br>

11. Laugh!
A study presented at the European Congress on Obesity found those who laughed hard for approximately 10 to 15 minutes each day burned an additional 10 to 40 calories a day. Multiply that by 365 and those calories can add up.
